## Aims
- Enable public users and staff to log issues quickly and accurately.
- Allow staff to assign, update, and close issues based on progress.
- Provide meaningful analytics to staff and administrators for decision-making.
- Ensure a secure and user-friendly system with scalable architecture.

## Users' Goals:
- Public users can create accounts, log in, and report issues.
- Staff members can manage, categorize, assign, and analyze issues.
- Admins can manage user permissions and monitor overall platform activity.

## Site Goals:
- Provide a clear and accessible interface for users of varying technical skills.
- Ensure security and data integrity through Django‚Äôs built-in authentication.
- Offer real-time data analysis and visualizations to support council operations.

## Target Audience
The primary audience includes:
- Local residents and public users wishing to report service issues.
- Council staff responsible for resolving and managing logged issues.
- Administrators overseeing system use and performance.

## Features to be included
- Secure registration and login (including Google OAuth).
- Ability to report, edit, and view issues.
- Staff-only tools for assigning issues, updating status, and categorizing.
- Commenting system for user and staff communication.
- Analytics dashboard for reporting trends, resolution times, and staff workload.
- Admin controls for managing user roles and CRUD access.
